# Astrix
A assembly like interpreted language.

# Why assembly 

I've always liked Assembly, but using it is complex, learning it is hard and switching architecture, operating system or assembler completely changes the language. Because of that, this language was created. There are many interpreted languages but I wanted one that resembled assembly, unfortunately there was none. 

also creating an assembly like language is easier.

# Note

This language is supposed be assembly like.
