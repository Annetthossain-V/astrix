# Astrix
An assembly like interpreted language.

# Why assembly 

I've always liked Assembly, but using it is complex, learning it is hard and switching architecture, operating system or assembler completely changes the language. Because of that, this language was created. There are many interpreted languages but I wanted one that resembled assembly, unfortunately there was none. 

also creating an assembly like language is easier.

# Note

This language is supposed be assembly like. 

How the language is supposed look like is up to the individual coding it but it must resemble assembly of any architecture, OS and assembler.
The language does not do syntax checks, safety is also low.
This language expects you to know to it works and invalid syntax and arguments could cause instability.
